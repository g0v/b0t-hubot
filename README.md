## Install & run

 1. Change settings on `env.sh`, choose a nickname.

 2. `./install.sh`

 3. `./run.sh` (this will run a bot on irc by the hubot-irc adaptor. Before going online, please test your bot with `./b0t/bin/hubot` first. Try not to flood the channel.)


## What's next?

 * Write hubot scripts: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md

 * List of available hubot scripts: http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/


> robot.hear is dangerous, we may cause a infinite bot-to-bot chatting. Use it carefully (there seems no OP to stop the robots :p ).
