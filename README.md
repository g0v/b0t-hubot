## What/Why is this project?
 * Please read [g0v irc robot by hubot](https://g0v.hackpad.com/g0v-irc-robot-by-hubot-IBmzHC20wBb)

## Install & run

 1. Change settings on `env.sh`, choose a nickname.

 2. `./install.sh`

 3. `./run.sh` (this will run a bot on irc by the hubot-irc adaptor. Before going online, please test your bot with `./b0t/bin/hubot` first. Try not to flood the channel.)


## What's next?

 * Write hubot scripts: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md

 * List of available hubot scripts: http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/


`robot.hear` is dangerous (use `robot.respond` instead), we may cause a infinite bot-to-bot chatting. There seems no OP to stop the robots :p.
